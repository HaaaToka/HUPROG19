\maketitle
There are N buildings in Sincan which connect with following property.

For any subset $A$ of $7$ buildings of all buildings, there are some two buildings $a,b \in A$, and some building $c \notin A$ such that all paths from $a$ to $b$ contain building $c$.

You will help the prime minister of Sincan to find the number of ways to properly color these buildings in $1,2...,n$ colors modulo $998244353$

All buildings are colored in $k$ colors by assigning an integer from $1$ to $k$ to every building.
If any two buildings are connected, their colors must be different.

\newline
\subsection*{Input Format:}
The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of building and the number of connections in Sincan.

The next $m$ lines contain description of the connections of the Sincan.
Each of these lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ describing an connection between buildings $a_i$ and $b_i$.
There are no multiple connections.

It is guaranteed that for any subset $A$ of $7$ buildings of the Sincan, there are some two buildings $a, b \in A$ and some building $c \notin A$ such that all paths from $a$ to $b$ contain building $c$.


\newline
\subsection*{Constraints:}
$1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$ \newline
$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n$, $a_i \neq b_i$

\newline
\subsection*{Output Format:}
Print one line containing $n$ space-separated integers.
The $i$-th integer must be the number of ways to properly color the Sincan in $i$ colors, taken modulo $998244353$.
