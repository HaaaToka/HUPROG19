You have an undirected graph with the following property:

For any subset $A$ of $7$ vertices of the graph, there are some two vertices $a, b \in A$ and some vertex $c \notin A$ such that all paths from $a$ to $b$ contain vertex $c$.

You need to find the number of ways to properly color this graph in $1, 2, \ldots, n$ colors modulo $998\,244\,353$.

A graph is colored in $k$ colors by assigning an integer color from $1$ to $k$ to every vertex.
A coloring is proper if the endpoints of each edge in the graph have different colors.


\newline
\subsection*{Input Format:}

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of vertices and the number of edges in your graph.

The next $m$ lines contain description of the edges of the graph.
Each of these lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ describing an edge between vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$.
There are no multiple edges.

It is guaranteed that for any subset $A$ of $7$ vertices of the graph, there are some two vertices $a, b \in A$ and some vertex $c \notin A$ such that all paths from $a$ to $b$ contain vertex $c$.




\newline
\subsection*{Constraints:}
$1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$ \newline
$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n$, $a_i \neq b_i$

\newline
\subsection*{Output Format:}

Print one line containing $n$ space-separated integers.
The $i$-th integer must be the number of ways to properly color this graph in $i$ colors, taken modulo $998\,244\,353$.
